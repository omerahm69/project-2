# project2
This is my second Project in the Fullstack Developer program at Code Institute. The project is about building an interactive Front-End web application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The title of the game is:
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock Game

The goal of the project is to provide a challenging game with increasing levels of difficulty to entertain online users.

The user's goal is to play an online game that has elements of chance. The site would respons to the user'saction and and encorage him/her to play showing the score of both user and computer. As a user when I see the score this will let me try several time to win a gainst the computer and so I will push different button in several tries hopping to win.

Features:
The main feature of the project is expected to be:
    1.The ability to play against the computer
    2. A score tracking system
    3. A limited number of tries before the game is over
    4. Pattern matching functionality

Wireframe below shows the design I have chosen for the game. The site has only one page that consits of a title, Rock Paper Scissors Lizards and Spock. A game area for the user and the computer. A score area and a control area with five buttons as mentioned on the title.

Accessibility Testing
To check the colors and fonts I used Lighthouse in the Google devtools. The result are shown below:


Manual Testing:
I have tested that the project is reponsive with different device sizes.it looks good and functions as normal.


Unfixed Bugs:
After playing a limited number of tries and the game ends, the user should have the ability to restart the game to try another time. This  should be fixed n the near future. 

Deployment and Forking:
Fork 
1. On Github.com, navigate to the omerahm69.github.io/project-2 repository

3. By default, forks are named the same as their parent repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.
4. Add a description to your fork.
5. Click Create to your fork.

1. Above the list of files click the button that says 'Code'.
2. Copy the URL for the repository.
3. Open Terminal. Change the directory to the location where you want the cloned directory
4. Type git clone, and the paste the URL https://omerahm69.github.io/project-2/
