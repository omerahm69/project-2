# project2
This is my second Project in the Fullstack Developer program at Code Institute. The project is about building a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game using HTML, CSS and JavaSript.

The goal of the project is to provide a challenging game with increasing levels of difficulty to entertain online users.

The user's goal is to play an online game that has elements of chance

The main feature of the project is expected to be:
    1.The ability to play against the computer
    2. A score tracking system
    3. A limited number of tries before the game is over
    4. Pattern matching functionality
